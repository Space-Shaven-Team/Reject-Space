# Why was the previous repository deleted?

> Initially, I decided to abandon the project, but realized that someone might be interested (xD). And decided to create. The name is now normal. But keep in mind that the development may take a long time. (That's fucked up, so don't send the cum)


# Ideas, partially adapted (Spizzhenno, but generally little :))
